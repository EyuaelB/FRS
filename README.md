Flight Reservation System 
School Project


This is a school project I did back in the day, It is a simplistic and a sample of a Flight Reservation System built with .NET, The busiiness logic is all commented out when put on github as it is made locally then reposited to Github. The application has Admin, Passenger and Receptionist MVC structure.
